# LL(K) Parser in C

An **LL(K) parser** is a top-down parser that reads input from left to right and constructs a **leftmost derivation** with K tokens of lookahead. It is commonly used in compilers to parse **context-free grammars**. The "LL" refers to Left-to-right scanning and Leftmost derivation, while "K" represents the number of tokens to look ahead.

## Features

- **Predictive Parsing**: The parser uses lookahead tokens to decide which production rule to apply.
- **Efficient**: Can be implemented with recursive descent functions, avoiding backtracking.
- **Error Handling**: Can report syntax errors early by detecting unexpected tokens.

## C Implementation

In C, an LL(K) parser is typically implemented using **recursive functions** for each grammar rule. The parser consumes tokens, checks lookahead symbols, and recursively builds the syntax tree.
